But the idea is that all the names will be selected and that means that the names list is being updated on each pick and the selected names are removed from the list. When the 'updated' list is empty it will load the names list from the given file and go again.\r\n\r\n#Your ideas\r\nIf you have some ideas you want to share with me, go ahead and reach me by [email](mailto:cijalm@gmail.com)\r\n",
